MAXIMUM BEAR ENFORCEMENT

By now, you all know and love the Bears database. Its creation code is on my branch (HigginsE), if you've not already built it. 
There is one major flaw, however... 
We are setting a MAX_BEARS value for each cave and not enforcing this limit. 
Your task this week is to devise a method for ensuring that all of the caves have no more bears than allowed. 

There are several methods by which this can be accomplished.
Upload as a solution the code to create whatever structures you decide to use, plus the creation statements for your tables. 

Use what you know about functions, triggers, error handling, stored procedures, etc. 
Include a description of why you chose the tools you did, and how your solutions works. Defend your choice!
