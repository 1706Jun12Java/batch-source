				<p>Fluff that up. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't
					have big clouds. Here's something that's fun. You gotta think like
					a tree. Let your imagination be your guide. It's so important to do
					something every day that will make you happy. I get carried away
					with this brush cleaning. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint.
					That's much harder. You can create anything that makes you happy.
					We'll make some happy little bushes here. And I will hypnotize that
					just a little bit. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them
					happy. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Even
					trees need a friend. We all need friends. Every day I learn. We'll
					put some happy little leaves here and there. Only think about one
					thing at a time. Don't get greedy. How do you make a round circle
					with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. See there
					how easy that is. The more we do this - the more it will do good
					things to our heart. Life is too short to be alone, too precious.
					Share it with a friend. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a
					whisper floating across a mountain. Clouds are free they come and
					go as they please. If I paint something, I don't want to have to
					explain what it is. We don't have to be committed. We are just
					playing here. These things happen automatically. All you have to do
					is just let them happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes
					here, just covered with snow. The very fact that you're aware of
					suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and
					can experience it. We want to use a lot pressure while using no
					pressure at all. Work that paint. Very easy to work these to death.
					We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. All
					you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a
					vision in your mind. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.
					This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. See. We
					take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. All
					you have to do is let your imagination go wild. We need dark in
					order to show light.</p>
