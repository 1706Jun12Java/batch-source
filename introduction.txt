My name is Dingchao Liao, I preferred to be called Dc. Some people like to make jokes
with this name because "Dc" stands for various meanings in different fields. For example,
in games "Dc" generally means disconnected. In pharmacies, "Dc" stands for discontinued.
I don't really care what people think. I like to be called this way; it is easy to remember and easy to say.
